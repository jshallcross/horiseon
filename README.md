Landing page for Horiseon.
The client had asked me to update their website landing page so it is optimized for search engines and follows accessibility standards. 
The existing code was refactored with semantic HTML that now follows a logical structure.
Comments were added and duplicate code was deleted to keep the project DRY.
Broken links were fixed and the project is now live at the link below.
